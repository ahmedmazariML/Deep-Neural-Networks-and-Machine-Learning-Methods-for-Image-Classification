# Deep-Neural-Networks-and-Machine-Learning-Methods-for-Image-Classification

Recently, deep learning models have drastically outperformed benchmark results on miscellaneous datasets. It’s has become 
state-of-the-art in various domain especially computer vision and speech recognition. This breakthrough in artificial 
intelligence is associated with the availability of massive amount datasets and the high computing power. However, to train a 
deep learning model over a massive dataset makes the training slow and memory consuming. The target is to build models that 
generalize well on new examples in a reasonable time.
In this study, we address the problem of images classification by implementing different machine learning and deep learning 
algorithms. Then, we make a performance analysis on this methods under the accuracy criterion in order to show the efficiency 
and the contribution of deep learning. To do so, we’ve choosen linear and non-linear learning algorithms which are : Logistic 
Regression, Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) , Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) tested on 
MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets by applying the standard version of gradient descent optimization algorithm.
